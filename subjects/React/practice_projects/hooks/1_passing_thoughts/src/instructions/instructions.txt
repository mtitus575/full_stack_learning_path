## Passing Thoughts ##
Project Brief:
    What if you could post something and know it wouldn’t live forever? 
    In this project, we’ll build a place for our passing thoughts. 
    Once you add a short thought, it’ll disappear after just 15 seconds.

Instructions:
[X] 1. Set up a new React app using Create React App or Vite.  
[X] 2. Create an `App` component to hold the main state: an array of thought objects.  
[X] 3. Build an `AddThoughtForm` component with an input and submit button to add new thoughts.  
[X] 4. Add logic to create a new thought object with a unique id, text, and expiration time.  
[X] 5. Render a list of `Thought` components, each displaying a thought’s text and a delete button.  
[X] 6. Implement manual deletion of thoughts by clicking the delete button.  
[] 7. Use `useEffect` in `Thought` to automatically remove a thought after 15 seconds.  
[] 8. Style the app for a clean, user-friendly interface.

Other details:
Consider these points:
- Prevent empty thoughts from being added.
- Clear the input after submitting a thought.
- Clean up timers in `useEffect` to avoid memory leaks.
- Handle edge cases, like deleting a thought before its timer ends.
- Give feedback when the thoughts list is empty.
- Use unique keys for each thought in the list.
- Keep code organized with clear component structure and comments.
- Make sure the app is accessible (labels for inputs, button aria-labels).
- Disable the submit button when the input is empty.
- Handle rapid adding/removing of thoughts gracefully.
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety if desired.
- Test the app for unexpected behavior or errors.
- Use consistent formatting and naming for readability.
