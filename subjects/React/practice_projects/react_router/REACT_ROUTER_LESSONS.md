## Progress Tracker

### **Phase 1: Foundation** üå±

- [x] **Lesson 1:** What is React Router?

  - Understanding the concept of client-side routing

    1. The problem with traditional websites:

       - You click "About" or "Contact" and the browser loads an entire new page from the server.
       - Each click causes a full page refresh which is SLOW and JARRING UX.

    2. The React solution is to create a Single Page Application (SPA):
       - Where the entire app loads at ONCE.
       - Navigating to various sections causes react to SWAP components.
       - No page refreshes occur! MUCH FASTER and SMOOTH

  - Why we need React Router in single-page applications

    1. Without routing in React:
       -- The URL always stays the same!
       -- Cannot bookmark specific pages.
       -- Back button does not work.
       -- Can't share links to specific pages.

    ```jsx
    // This is what happens without React Router
    function App() {
      const [page, setPage] = useState("home");

      if (page === "home") return <Home />;
      if (page === "about") return <About />;
      // URL stays the same! Always shows: localhost:3000
    }
    ```

    2. WITH React Router:
       -- It syncs the URLs with specific components.
       -- Makes the back button work.
       -- URLs can be bookmarked.
       -- Enables link sharing.

    ```jsx
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} /> {/* localhost:3000 */}
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} /> {/* localhost:3000/about */}
    </Routes>
    ```

    3. Real-world examples:
       -- Consider Gmail:
       ---> gmail.com/inbox shows the inbox.
       ---> gmail.com/sent shows the sent emails.
       ---> gmail.com/drafts shows the drafts.

- [ ] **Lesson 2:** Basic Setup

  - Installing React Router DOM
    **Step 1**

    - In the terminal run `npm install react-router-dom`
      -- What is react-router-dom?
      ==> The web version of React Router which contains the components we need (`BrowserRouter, Routes, Route`, etc)

  - Setting up BrowserRouter in your app
    **Step 2**

    - React Router MUST wrap the entire APP. It is the router manager that watches the URL changes.
    - All the code in the App.jsx needs to be wrapped inside a `BrowserRouter` component.

    ```jsx
    import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
    import "./App.css";

    function App() {
      return (
        <BrowserRouter>
          {/*ALL the child elements inside the BrowserRouter has access to routing*/}
          <div>
            <h1> My React Router App</h1>
            <p> Routing setup complete!</p>
          </div>
        </BrowserRouter>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    **Step 3**: Test the App
    -- Save file
    -- run `npm start`
    -- visit localhost:server
    --\* The app should run normally with no errors! This means it worked.

    - The BrowserRouter:
      -- Listens to URL changes
      -- Provides the routing context for ALL child components
      -- Enables the browser's back and forward buttons
      -- Syncs your app with the browser's address bar

    - There are 2 common setup patterns:
      -- 1: Wrap in the App.jsx (as above)

      ```jsx
      function App() {
        return <BrowserRouter>{/* Your app content */}</BrowserRouter>;
      }
      ```

    -- 2: Wrap in index.jsx (alternative)

        ```jsx
        root.render(
        <BrowserRouter>
            <App />
        </BrowserRouter>
        );
        ```

    - Troubleshooting:
      --Errors:
      --> Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-router-dom'
      ---- The fix: run `npm install react-router-dom` again
      --> BrowserRouter is not defined
      ---- The fix: Check the `import` statement.

## Learning Notes üìù

### Key Concepts to Remember:

- React Router enables client-side routing (no page refreshes)
- `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` are better than `<a>` tags
- Routes are matched from top to bottom
- URL parameters make routes dynamic
- Nested routes create hierarchical structures

### Common Patterns:

```jsx
// Basic route structure
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>
```

## Quick Reference üîç

### Essential Components:

- `BrowserRouter` - Wraps your entire app
- `Routes` - Container for all routes
- `Route` - Defines a single route
- `Link` - Navigation without page refresh
- `NavLink` - Link with active state styling

### Essential Hooks:

- `useParams()` - Get URL parameters
- `useNavigate()` - Programmatic navigation
- `useLocation()` - Get current location info
