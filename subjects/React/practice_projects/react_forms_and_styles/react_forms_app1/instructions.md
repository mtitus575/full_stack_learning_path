# Saucy Tango Food Order Form
In this practice project, you will create a food order form for a restaurant.

The local mom-and-pop shop, Saucy Tango, has received a lot of love from the community recently. To keep up with demand, they’ve decided to open their restaurant for online orders. They’ve entrusted this task to you, a budding React developer.

Your goal is to create a functional form that allows customers to place their orders easily. Once the customer submits the form, the form will alert them about their order details. You will be provided with a menu and your task is to create a form that can take in customer details such as name, phone number, address, and order.

To complete this project, you will use your understanding of controlled React forms. You’ll be using the State Hook to manage the state of the form, and employ event handlers to update the state of the form as the customer fills in their details.

## Objctives
1.[X] Set up a new React app using Create React App.
2.[X] Create a `FoodOrderForm` component.
3.[X] Add a `<form>` with input fields for name, phone, address, and order.
4.[X] Add labels for each input for accessibility.
5.[X] Add a submit button to the form.
6.[X] Use React state to control each input field.
7.[X] Add `onChange` handlers to update state as the user types.
8.[X] Handle form submission to show an alert with the order details.
9.[X] Add appropriate input types and names for each field.
10.[X] Style the form for a clean user experience.

## Consider these extra steps for a complete experience:
- Validate user input (e.g., require all fields, check phone format).
- Clear the form after successful submission.
- Display error messages for invalid input.
- Organize components if the app grows (e.g., separate menu and form).
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety.
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for scoped styling.
- Optionally, connect to a backend or local storage to save orders.
