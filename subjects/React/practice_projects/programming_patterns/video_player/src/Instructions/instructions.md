# Video Player (mini app)
## Brief:
You just learned your first programming pattern. Let’s put it to use!

For this project, you’ll make three React components work together to create a responsive video player.

## Objectives:
-[X] Set up a new React app using Create React App or Vite.  
-[X] Create an `App` component to manage the video source state.  
-[X] Create a `Video` component to display the video player, receiving the video source as a prop.  
-[X] Create a `Menu` component with radio buttons or a dropdown to select different videos.  
-[X] Pass the current video source from `App` to `Video` as a prop.  
-[X] Pass a handler from `App` to `Menu` to update the video source when a new video is selected.  
-[X] Update the video player when a new source is chosen.  
-[] Style the app for a clean, user-friendly interface.

### Additional points to consider:
-[X] Prevent selecting the same video from reloading it.
-[X] Make sure the video player is accessible (labels for controls, keyboard navigation).
- Handle cases where a video fails to load (show an error message).
